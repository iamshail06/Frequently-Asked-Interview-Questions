1. In SQL query execution what is the difference between CTE (common table expression) and TEMP tables and when to use?

        1. CTE are executed in Memory where as temporary tables are physically created on disk
        2. CTEs exist only for the duration of a particular query, while temporary tables can be used in other queries as many times since these stored on disk
        3. We can explicitly create, alter, or drop a temporary table, but it is not possible in CTE.
        4. CTEs are only accessible within the query that defines them, while temporary tables can be accessed by multiple queries within the same batch
        5. CTEs are more efficient for small data sets, while temporary tables may be more efficient for larger data sets
        6. Temporary tables can have constraints and indexes, while CTEs cannot.
        7.  CTEs are useful for making code easier to write, reusing code, and handling complex scenarios like recursive queries. 
        8. Temporary tables are useful when we need to refer to output multiple times, pass data between stored procedures, or break a query into phases.
